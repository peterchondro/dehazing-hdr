# dehazing-hdr
This repository demonstrates an a portion of image preprocessing that I proposed in 2020, which includes adjustments of each pixel value in order to remove haze/fog/light rain effect as well as to improve its contrast that could be deprecated from dehazing removal. This a re-implementation in C# using OpenTK context with CPU and fragment shader.
